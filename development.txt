All necessary software is available in \\shares.ecs.soton.ac.uk\lsl\Research Projects\MACFOB\software\development

1.1) create macfob/svn directory
	mkdir macfob\svn

1.2) go to created macfob/svn directory
	cd macfob\svn

1.3) checkout HEAD revision of MACFOB project from SVN repository into macfob\svn directory
	svn co https://macfob.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/macfob/trunk

2.1) install MySQL 5.0+ Community Server
- http://www.mysql.com
- mysql-5.0.51b-win32.zip
- recommended way is to choose Custom Installation and change installation path to C:\Software\mysql-5.0

- configuration of installed mysql
-> Detailed Configuration
-> Developer Machine
-> Multifunctional Database
-> Installation Path
-> Decision Support (DSS)/OLAP
-> everything checked (do not forget to check: Add firewall exception for this port)
-> Best Support For Multilingualism
-> everything checked (do not forget to check: Include Bin Directory in Windows PATH)
-> choose your root password (otherwise default settings)
-> Execute
-> Finish

- execute this command to verify successful installation:
	mysql -u root -p

- it is recommended to set mysql service startup from Automatic to Manual
(you have to start it manualy but it doesn't eat system resources until you need it)

2.2) create synote's database
- execute these commands in mysql shell:
	create database synote;
	grant all on synote.* to 'synote'@'localhost' identified by 'synote';

2.3) initialize synote's database
- execute these scripts in mysql shell:
	macfob/svn/projects/synote/script/sql/create.sql
	macfob/svn/projects/synote/script/sql/init.sql

- one possible way how to do it:
	cd macfob/svn/projects/synote/script/sql
	mysql -u synote -p  (password is : synote)
	use synote;
	source create.sql;
	source init.sql;

- The database initialized by the above two ways will be empty (no recordings in it). In order to have 
  some recordings in the database, you can init the database in the following way:
    execute create.sql
    execute mysql -u root -p synote < synote-rXXXX-DD-MM-YYYY.sql
  
  synote is name of the database. synote-rXXXX-DD-MM-YYYY.sql is the database backup in 
  \\shares.ecs.soton.ac.uk\lsl\Research Projects\MACFOB\backup\mysql\XXXX "XXXX" is the number of snapshot

3.1) install Java JDK 1.5+

	grails run-app

- there must be free port 8080 in your system!
- last line of output should be: Server running. Browse to http://localhost:8080/synote
-> go to this URL to verify successful server startup: http://localhost:8080/synote

6.2) go to this URL and register new user: http://localhost:8080/synote/user/register
